    "A dataset from the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) will be used to create and train multiple models, which will be evaluated for a comparison of each modelâ€™s accuracy. The SDOT data set includes entries for nearly 195,000 accidents from 2004 to the present. The severity of each accident is categorized with multiple features to choose from for modeling. A few examples of the features are as follows:\n",
    "* Collision Address Type (Alley, Block, Intersection)\n",
    "* Location\n",
    "* Collision Type\n",
    "* Number of people involved in the collision\n",
    "* Number of pedestrians involved in the collision\n",
    "* Number of cyclists involved in the collision\n",
    "* Number of vehicles involved in the collision\n",
    "* Number of fatalities\n",
    "* Weather conditions\n",
    "* Road conditions\n",
    "* Lighting Conditions\n",
    "* And more\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary focus of this investigation are the environmental driving conditions at the time of the collision. Therefore, the following features will be investigated:\n",
    "* Weather conditions (WEATHER)\n",
    "* Road conditions (ROADCOND)\n",
    "* Light conditions (LIGHTCOND)"
